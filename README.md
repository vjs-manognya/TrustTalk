TrustTalk: AI-Powered Real-Time Scam Call Detection

TrustTalk is an AI-based system designed to detect scam or fraudulent calls in real time by analyzing transcribed audio conversations. It uses multiple machine learning models trained on both real and synthetically generated spam call datasets to classify calls as fraud or normal.


🔍 Features

Real-Time Speech Recognition: Uses microphone input to transcribe voice into text.
Multi-Model Classification:

Multinomial Naive Bayes on GPT-generated dataset
Logistic Regression on real-world spam call dataset
Trained RoBERTa Model.

Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and Accuracy Score for both models.
GUI Support: Tkinter interface for easy use.

🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repo or download the files.
2. Install dependencies:

   bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib torch transformers speechrecognition ipywidgets
   
3. Make sure all required `.pkl` and `.csv` files are in the same directory.




This script will:

* Load the dataset and models
* Evaluate performance on test samples
* Print confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores
* Checks whether the call is spam or not.

📊 Example Output

Confusion Matrix :
 [[76  4]
 [ 5 15]]

Classification Report of MultinomalNB model trained using Synthetic Dataset Generated by ChatGPT:


Accuracy Score: 0.91


📌 Future Enhancements

* Add real-time microphone input support for live call detection
* Build a Tkinter GUI or a web interface
* Integrate with a RoBERTa model for deeper semantic understanding
